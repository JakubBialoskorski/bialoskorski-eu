This is an MVP of new portfolio webpage, written entirely in NextJS + TailWind CSS.

Few things needs to be done:
* image optimization & size decrease
* CSS purging of non-used elements to speed-up loading times
* debug of random 404 errors on the homepage during long image loads
* migration to NextJS 13 with the new `/app` directory
* extending theme colors over `<section>` borders for better mobile experience
* public domain switchover
